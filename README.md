## Description

The pgfgantt package provides the ganttchart environment, which
draws a Gantt chart within a TikZ picture. The user may add various
elements to the chart, for example, titles, bars, groups, milestones and different
links between these elements. The appearance of the chart elements
is highly customizable, and even new chart elements may be defined.

The package makes use of [pgf/TikZ](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf).


## Installation
