The pgfgantt package v5.0a
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package is released under the LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c or later
(see https://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt).


The pgfgantt package provides the ganttchart environment, which
draws a Gantt chart within a TikZ picture. The user may add various
elements to the chart, for example, titles, bars, groups, milestones and
different links between these elements. The appearance of the chart elements
is highly customizable, and even new chart elements may be defined.

The package requires pgf/TikZ (https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf).

Installation: Run pgfgantt.ins through LaTeX and follow the instructions.

This package is unmaintained. If you want to volunteer to take over
the maintenance, contact me at https://wolfgang.esser-skala.at/contact/ .
